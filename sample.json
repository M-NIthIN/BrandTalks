        "transcript": "Tesla said that they're bringing out new electric cars in 2025 new models apparently now it looks like Tesla will bring a larger vehicle than the Tesla Model Y is this actually accurate will it come out in 2025 well I'm not sure but there are some interesting indicators of what's been happening what Tesla is thinking about doing I'll share what those are hello my friends welcome to the channel I'm Sam Evans you're watching the electric Viking great to have you with us now if you're not already charging your electric car using solar like I am right at this moment in time looking at my phone here here is the amount of solar I'm producing right now in the top there and you can see how much power I'm taking out so I'm I'm taking out about 8.8 KW about eight of that is going well actually about seven of that is going into my EV well the EV sitting out here in the driveway so I highly recommend get solar right as you can see I'm making so much electricity right now even though this is not a not perfectly Sunny there's a couple of clouds in the sky it's a no brander you got to get solar it's so affordable now if you want to use the company that I use they have the best reviews I'll put a link in the description to them and if you mention me they'll give you a discount now to make it clear I don't make anything nothing from mentioning them I just had a good experience and I want you guys to as well El mus recently gave his approval for Tesla vehicles for bigger families interesting cuz he said um often when M mus does this he kind of doesn't give a direct answer but it appears as though he has here um here's what someone said on X Naomi CIT maybe she's famous I've never heard of her she texted this or tweeted this on X I was at my neighborhood Tesla store yesterday and wanted to make sure again that the X model is not big enough for my family it isn't she said so obviously she's got a bunch of kids and the model X isn't big enough for her um someone else said we need big Teslas for big families here's what she actually said I like this she said Tesla's proven to be the most efficient and popular car on the market but if we want more babies and to repopulate the West we need bigger models to support the lifestyle at Elon Musk imagine Tesla family road trips Across America now obviously this appeals to musk he has kids coming out all over the place I mean he's got like what 100 children by now I'm joking but he has a lot of kids right and I think one of the relationships he had with was it one of the high ranking neuralink staff members um she just wanted to have children and he she asked approached musk and said you know can we have uh can I have kids I want to have kids I want your DNA and musk was like yeah okay so this this kind of stuff is kind of wild it's kind of crazy but obviously people believe that there's problems there's not enough people having children and there therefore the populations will shrink in the Western World there already are look at South Korea the birth rate is 0.7 the worst in the world 0.7 so anyway mus is a big fan he must beli that's a problem as well and that in the future that the problem won't be too many people it'll be not enough potentially anyhow musk responded to this tweet he said okay so he seems to be saying yeah we will and I'm wondering if the reason he said okay is because tesel already have a big a bigger vehicle coming could it be a van a lot of people think it might be a van right A lot of people think Tesla are going to bring out an electric van we know they are going to bring an electric van but it's going to be that big thing that can can sit 20 to 30 people the spy wacky looking thing which is kind of cool the robo the robo van for example but I don't believe Tesla are planning on bringing out a van at this point in time just because it's a fairly niche market that said they would have the market all themselves there's not much in that segment for electric vans so I hope Tesla is working on electric van but I just think that at this point in time it sounds more likely that they're going to have a larger electric SUV the model X is a hard car to build it's cost of manufacturing is high Elon Musk has said this a few times Tesla mentioned this it's not a car that could really Mass produce it scale and sell it a profit it's simply too complicated so the strategy here would be the model X is now dated it's old it's been around a long time replace that with a new model X which can be mass-produced something like a larger version of the model y something maybe a little bit more relevant for families that will be affordable and has plenty of range that is potentially a car that could be coming from Tesla this year and if you think about it it makes sense Tesla has nothing in that segment the largest car they have for Global Production is the model y I mean very few countries can even get the model X the model Y is available in what like 80 countries worldwide best selling car in the world last year but it is true that a lot of people want a bigger car than the model y now I'm hoping that um Elon Musk isn't just saying okay um just to Plate them or these people I actually think TLA might be working on one and I really hope it comes soon thanks for watching [Music]"

        "transcript": "on today's episode the Tesla bot finds an unlikely new home Donald Trump will make autonomy great again Tesla's camera vision gets clearer and superchargers get a much needed power up Tesla has always been a popular brand among celebrities influencers and YouTubers we saw that really accelerate with the release of the Cyber truck which was quickly adopted by everyone from Sha to Justin Bieber to Serena Williams and Lady Gaga among countless other a-listers integrating Tesla even deeper in into the Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous and now Optimus the Tesla bot has already taken that one step further with none other than Kim Kardashian becoming the first customer to take delivery of a Tesla bot Kim got the show started in this video with her and Optimus you can see the bot doing some new moves like the hard sign and even what appears to be the Trump dance although we saw impressive progress on Optimus in the recent video update it seems likely this bot in Kim's video is teleop ated much like the demonstrations we saw at the Wii robot event where the Bots were playing rock paper scissors with the guests and more the Tesla team had some fun with their ex accounts commenting looks like the robots not coming back and the official Tesla Optimus account replying sorry you had to find out this way Elon just keeps the comments short with cool and it looks like Kim got to play with more than just one robot as she also shared a video of Optimus inside a cyber cab saying her ride is here I don't know if you noticed but this Optimus seems to be painted gold just like the Cyber cab according to the Instagram post only one such golden Optimus exists in the world she also gives the Tesla crew some shout outs saying have to give respect and credit to one of the best car designers ever fron Von Hol house in this car is crazy to which fron replies thanks Kim K amazing team more to come now we are not sure if we'll see an actual larger photo op with Kim coming online soon from this or some other kind of project but this seems like a sure way for Tesla to reach a wide audience just about 500 million followers across her socials this probably marks Tesla's biggest marketing play ever in company history they typically just rely on the fact that rich and famous people will buy their products and flex them on their own obviously Kim Kardashian didn't buy a Tesla bot and cyber cab because they're not for sale yet so this was all set up intentionally Kim's Instagram videos for a product feature reportedly go for about $2 million each so it seems Tesla has gotten a solid 10 million worth of an advertising campaign right there for free or at least we are assuming that Tesla didn't pay for this that would be very out of character now you might be thinking that Kim K is a weird choice to be the new Tesla brand ambassador and I thought the same thing to at first but if Tesla wants to reach a new audience of middle-aged women who are consumerism focused for lack of a better term then you probably can't get much better than Kim Kardashian's audience it's likely that most of her followers have never really seen a Tesla bot or a cyber cab before I can tell you for sure that not many women watch our videos either and this overcomes a major hurdle towards Tesla bot adoption by consumers now the husbands of the world don't even need to explain to their wives what Optimus is or why they should buy one of their own just say it's the same robot that Kim Kardashian has and you're good to go alternative Theory Elon has a new crush and instead of trying to woo her by sending her flowers he sent robots and guess what you can own a Tesla bot 2 well a mini version for now the Tesla bot action figure just hit the Tesla merch shop for $40 it did of course crash the whole site at launch and is now sold out but maybe you'll get lucky when they replenish the stock until then I've got the scoop on a brand new product that is coming soon and you're going to love it we are excited to share a first look at our new Tesla space merch designs dropping November 29th with an exclusive Black Friday sale as you can see it's a conversation starter a bold nod to boings space mishaps and a perfect way to show off your love of space with a bit of humor we'll be sharing another sneak peek later this week or you can see the complete collection by signing up for Early Access and special discounts using the link in the description below a new report shared over the weekend claims that the transition team for soon to be president Donald Trump is aiming to create new federal regulations governing self-driving vehicles and they are going to make the autonomous transport sector a top priority in the upcoming term the news comes at as Elon Musk has officially been named a co-leader of the Department of government efficiency or Doge for the upcoming Trump Administration Elon will be sharing that role with fellow entrepreneur vivec ramaswami who is the founder of a pharmaceutical company called royant Sciences the sources also said that autonomy laws would become a major priority for the US Department of Transportation who in the past have thwarted efforts to increase the number of available permits for self-driving Vehicles according to additional people familiar with the matter who spoke under the condition of anonymity the Trump team is also actively looking to find policy leaders to help develop the new guidelines and the new federal government isn't alone in wanting to advance self-driving technology here's Palo Alto California lawmaker Greg Tanica confirming he is in talks with Tesla to potentially allow testing of their Robo taxi on local roads currently the national highway traffic safety administration allows manufacturers to deploy a maximum of just 2500 self-driving vehicles per year now that's obviously nowhere near enough for Tesla to realize their multi-million vehicle robot taxi Network and in addition to limits on volume self-driving Vehicles without a steering wheel or accelerator pedals such as Tesla's recently unveiled cyber cab are not currently allowed to be deployed in America at all with the new Trump administration's focus on reduced bureaucracy and regulation combined with the massive influence of Elon Musk on the president it's looking like this is all about to change change and this is of course not just an American issue new rules for autonomous vehicles need to be established all around the world in the coming years which is exactly why the Cyber cab is touring Europe right now Tesla is taking the Cyber cab on a tour across six European cities London Paris Amsterdam Oslo Stockholm and Berlin on dates between November 20th and December 31st if this is anything like the Cyber truck tour we'll see more locations to follow shortly Yan our European correspondent who you hopefully seen reporting for us on the Tesla semi firstand and the guy behind the Tesla space newsletter will fly to London early next week and report back on the new Cyber cab straight from the Tesla showroom we've just learned that the 2025 Tesla Model y will have some upgraded protection for the rear camera in the form of a plastic lip around the camera lens which is extended slightly further for better shielding it might seem like a small Improvement but we would assume it will make quite a bit of difference as Tesla is increasingly relying on its camera for well everything one thing we noticed with the recently unveiled cyber cab is the lack of small washers for its cameras for a vehicle that is bound to be 100% autonomous and in service thanks to all its cameras we assume Tesla will figure out a way to keep those cameras clean at all times currently we've seen Tesla launch a built-in camera washer on cybertruck but only at the front and a lot of owners have been using aftermarket solutions to add the washer for the rear as well a near 350 KW what are you referring to a children's toy this is what Elon responded to the electric publisher Fred Lambert back in 2016 and yet even today Tesla's supercharging experience is not actually that powerful excluding the semi- mega charger of course but now we've got something a bit stronger than the children's toy this latest piece of the Tesla supercharging puzzle one we knew was coming and have been waiting for the V4 supercharging cabinet this with upgrades like 500 KW of potential output per charging post and up to 1.2 megaw in the Tesla semis case one cabinet can now be used for eight stalls up from four previously and it supports 400 volt to 1,000 volt architectures you might be a bit confused because well the V4 superchargers have been out there for a while already so let me brief you in 2023 Tesla launched its V4 supercharging post which is the charging dispenser and which was an upgrade on the previous one already however the cabinet the thing powering these dispensers close to the site has been remaining at V3 until now greatly limiting the V4 supercharger capabilities now with the V4 cabinet launch these limitations are gone now the other thing limiting EVS charging is their own architecture and this is why the current upgrade is mostly for capable EVS from other makers plus the Tesla cyber truck the ladder now charges 30% faster while the rest of the s3xy doesn't really really gain anything and stays at their 250 Kow charge rates Tesla however wins from this upgrade the most it can now install two times the Stalls per cabinet a total of eight and lowers the footprint and complexity of site developments Tesla is also using The Cutting Edge power Electronics designed to be the most reliable on the planet with three times the power density enabling higher throughput with lower costs the first sites with V4 cabinets are going into permitting now first openings will come in 2020 5 we also found additional comments from Max dger director of charging North America at Tesla confirming that the full power isn't always needed and what they win from it posts can Peak up to 500 Kow for cars but we need less than 1 megawatt across eight posts to deliver maximum power to cars 99% of the time no more DC bus bar between cabinets power comes from a single V4 cabinet to eight stalls easier to install cheaper more reliable even some of the small all incremental improvements matter V4 cabinets has a 2% efficiency Improvement superchargers already deliver over 5 ter hours per year 100 gwatt hours per year in waste heat that can be saved"

        "transcript": "all right all right welcome everybody so this is a weekly live stream that we do with my co-host here you got Brian from future AA you got Nick from investing Against the Grain today's topic is about Tesla and whether or not we are now at a point where it's changed forever we're going to go through some of the things that's happened in the last couple weeks that some of them are reversible some of them are not reversible but there's a few things that have happened or about to happen the narrative has changed but there's also things that uh we're going to kind of see where are we now has the story changed but has Tesla generally being seen differently by investors now welcome every everybody Welcome Brian and Nick how are you guys doing I'm doing all right I'm worried about Nick how are you Nick's all right let me start off with disclaimer so nobody starts putting things in the comments to Herbert I'm homeless right now we got flood out of our house during the hurricane I'm using my airpods Mike sucks I'm sorry don't blame Herbert maybe blame Brian but can't do anything about it so please everybody be patient but other than that I'm doing good we're recovering got these two guys how could I not be good oh thank I just thought that's what your voice sounded like no no I've I've seen the dude the guy's gorgeous voice gorgeous dude all right but um no appreciate you Nick obviously yeah audio is just something guys I I can't can't figure this out I mean I've been doing this for two years two or three shows a day and every kind of month something happens with the audio trying to fix it trying to do something better about it okay let's talk Tesla I'm going to go through a few things here that has happened in just the last two weeks and again not sure if this is something that is fundamentally changed Tesla forever or not you guys can explain to me but first off if we just kind of review what's happened with institutional analyst Morgan Stanley Adam Jonas thinks that the Trump winning the election will help accelerate Tesla's Journey Beyond Autos so they've got their beautiful chart here they're explaining that Tesla is not just an autoc company but that you know Elon being part of the Trump Administration or at least the administration supporting Elon it's going to help Tesla's Journey Beyond Autos you've got them also saying that the that they're now seeing a $500 bull case in play and and the reason I'm bring this up is that many institutional investors are saying the same things here they point out that losing the $7,500 EV credit if that is what happens in the US that's might already be pricing a stock but the leadership in embodied Ai and autonomous technology with these potential policy accelerant may not be yet in um be part of the price into the stock at this point you've got of course the potential that the this rumors that the Trump team is saying that they want to ease us rules for self-driving cars there's that potential there you've got this new Secretary of Transportation uh just been announced yesterday sha Duffy Sean is a very much a bull a Tesla an autonomous vehicle bowl and uh he this was a 2018 he he was interviewed and even way back then he was a very very supportive of autonomous vehicles he's very supportive of Tesla so those were just a few of the things that happened there's more we haven't even talked about it yet you know price changes structural changes that Tesla is doing let's pause there and just explore that these things we've heard they're still about the future right I mean Trump has been elected that is for sure he's he's assigned all of these new uh assignments cabinet members that's true but then these kind of ideas that they're going to be much more supportive is that already starting to be built into stock is this reversible or do we think that this really is you know straight uh we we're changing we're going into a new Direction here I'll let you go first on this one Nick because what I heard was 500 questions and I don't know where to start sorry um yeah you know same uh let me just tell you what I'm thinking I think people need to be careful right now with um the market not just Tesla but Tesla's part of it we don't know what to be careful of because he looks like he got frozen are you frozen Brian oh I I didn't you look Frozen to me Herbert you look Frozen to me yeah okay keep going interesting uh so mic may not be good but the video is quality um yeah I think everybody needs to be careful with the market right now um and I bucket Tesla into this because there's definitely a big sense of it's not fro on M Herbert or you're fine you're fine guys Herbert doesn't like where I'm going with this so he keeps uh silencing my free speech here me yeah I think it is you likewise I think it's you so a bucket of uh something yes so I think there's a lot of um I don't want to say fomo but a lot of euphoria in the market right now you can see it primarily right now with Bitcoin you can see it with micro strategy um there's a lot of people legging into this Market and C trying to catch this wave so whatever happens with Tesla I would just caution a little bit that could it get to 410 415 all-time highs yes of course it can I mean it was already there once and things are so much different now right now we have the set truck now we have all these factories open now we know what states are going to start with FSD uh Robo taxi now we know what the Cyber cab looks like right on and on so obviously we could get back to where we were but it's just hard not to caveat when you see micro strategy up 5% in like a minute right and Bitcoin breaking alltime highs left and right and everything is hockey sticking up it's hard to not caution that what goes up does tend to come back down at least a little bit so that's all I would say because I get it it's easy to just look in the Tesla window but you know this is very reminiscent of what we saw in the past and it's fun it's exciting while you catch the the wave it's a nice ride but just be careful that's all I'm saying okay well Nick I'm not referring to the you know stock price this show right we're talking about whether or not not only the narrative but test Tesla story change and how they're being viewed by investors for all of these these things that have happened over the last couple weeks just feel like you can't you can't take them apart from each other because the reason everyone's talking about it now the reason Adam Jones he's saying is because of this whole narrative change with the new presidency or the new um President elect coming in and that is directly affecting the stock the stock didn't go above 300 we wouldn't be having this conversation about the institutional investors right now like we'd be talking about when are we going to do this when's the market going to realize right so it just just it's just a warning flag that's all just turn it out there okay so you think that everything that's happen is reversible of course of course yeah what do you think Brian listen y i i don't think prices always regress back to the mean but volatility always regresses I'm not referring to the prices I know you had a very good argument though yeah you're right that the reason we're having this conversation because the stock went up well guess what I'm say saying the stock went up because of things that have started to happen that investors in general are starting to see now and recognize now that they didn't before so the stock didn't just go up by itself right without any changes it was because of trump Administration Elon being part of that the view that the regulation is going to change specifically for robo taxi and now everybody believes that robotaxi is going to happen especially after the 1010 event remember after the 1010 event at that point no one did no one thought not no one but few people bought into the autonomy story it was only when after the 1010 event then you had this structural change in the the administration of the government then that's what made everything work and so isn't that a thing that is not reversible in the sense that uh it's happened and now the belief that all these things will will be in U coming in in favor of el and Tesla so I'm going to say that uh like Nick said it is all reversible but let's start with the biggest one um Trump could change his mind on how he feels about Elon if that happens then who knows what happens with all of these potential goodies that are on the table that happened in 2016 he was the first one uh the most visible person added to his Science and Technology Council which met once drafted a whole bunch of uh ideas handed them over and as far as he could tell no one read them the group never met again he was the first one to quit and their relationship soured Trump said some truly truly ghoulishly awful things about Elon on social media and uh now they're friends again but if you can lose a friend and gain a friend that quick um you can lose them again easy come easy go but uh that's one possible way it could uh could be undone a bit there's other factors the the biggest factor I see helping right now is yes all of this happened over the past couple weeks and we've seen the stock run up but remember how long it's been trading sideways there's only so much you can load the spring before it pops again I would say that the price to earnings is higher than a lot of investors are comfortable with but that doesn't mean it's too high uh a lot of people myself included are not consider considering the past 12 months profit uh price earnings the past month's price I'm looking at 5 years out 10 years out and I'm looking at this and saying if I was the kind of person who would sell because the price to earnings got too high at these levels I never would have invested in the first place because in 2019 the company was not making money I mean it was it was a little scary there for a while uh but I am always looking out into the future and it doesn't have to Tesla doesn't have to nail every one of these Landings to justify today's prices let alone tomorrow's prices they only have to nail one of them uh to to Really moon on this one all right I don't think I'm explaining myself well so I titled this topic as Tesla has now changed forever and what I mean by that is that you know us retail investors we all saw Tesla a certain way for the last several years right it's going to be the leader in electric vehicles it's got all these different business units like energy wait until Energy starts showing up it's got Robo taxi we believe strongly that at some point FSD will work and we're going to be heading that direction and that there's no other car company no other autonomous car company that's going to match that you got the robot coming we believe that at some point that that will work all of these things that we examine right the Tesla semi business the the autonomous autonomy of the the the benefit the value propositions of all these manufacturing firm the the factories that we able to build we believe that but the stock was flat and low and lots of lots of shorts were there a lot of other people on the other side says no they're not the only car company this is an example of remember we saw this come out why is Tesla worth a trillion dollars when all these other car companies uh and Tesla's a car company it's overpriced the stock is overpriced remember that that was happening what I'm saying is now Tesla has not changed but the but everything that we believed for the last year is now something that everyone or more people more let's put this way more people are now starting to see that same story something changed there so today you're now hearing everybody say Yes Energy is a business well what has changed well energy actually showed up on the earnings it showed up in the sales then now so that was clear now there remember there is Tesla is not an AI company and we were saying Tesla's an AI company now you're hearing everybody saying it's an AI company now why how did that what what made them start saying that Tesla is an AI company is it because of deregulation or regulations coming for federal framework for autonomous cars is all of a sudden they're starting to see this and I think that that's what I mean by think Tesla is no longer is now changed forever because the the the story that we've been hammering home is now being seen by a broader group of investors and as that happens we're now heading to the next stage there'll be another thing where they don't get and they'll take them like for example the bot no one's talking about the bot yet today at some point they will but where we're at today we finally have a good siiz group of investors realizing that Tesla is an actual you know Robo tax is real energy is real and all these other businesses are real so it's less at Tesla's fun mentals have changed it's more that the you know finally we've got a good siiz group of investors who realize what they're seeing now I thought that was the question we were answering as far as I heard but uh I'll I'll play your game Herbert yeah those are all real things and like you were saying with MEAP pack when I interviewed Matt Smith two years ago I said when is uh Wall Street going to start pricing it in and his answer was when it shows up on the quarterly and then it did and then they did I still think they're undervaluing it they're trying to drive into the future by staring into the rearview mirror and if you do that it'll work great as long as there are no bends in the road and this road is bending upward so I don't think they're pricing in meapa tre shangh High which is going to have tremendous margins and we suspect two to three times the volume that we see out of lrip so it is uh that alone I mean just not counting that is a little crazy um and the reason we're seeing people start to recognize the AI story is because Tesla not only has AI not only has it out in the world but is monetizing it with monthly subscriptions to FSD and with the sale of FSD and it is uh it is there it is on the balance sheet whether whether people admit that it's real or not um and that will expand of course it'll expand into how the bot is driven if the bot was a piece of hardware they could Market it today they could sell it today there are Bots as you know that are already on the market that have everything they need except the brain and the brain is the hardest part you know high schoolers can build humanoid robots what they can't do is make it do anything truly valuable so as soon as as soon as people understand that cortex will be able to make uh Optimus do just about anything is the day that uh I think Wall Street will start to recognize it but I would agree with your premise that we are in a new place we are no longer guessing and hoping for the future we are seeing the fruits of these developments uh in the real world so Herbert I get the premise of your question I just don't really agree with it I don't think that all of a sudden people are recognizing Tesla tril AI company and they get the Rob with taxi finally and they understand it's also an energy company I think that um look what what happened was Trump won elon's tied to Trump Biden they like Trump investors are are readjusting where they have their bets and I think that's what we see here so in my opinion everything we've seen so far has zero to do with people saying oh damn Tesla's an AI company or oh damn Tesla's gonna be the one to solve robot taxis in my opinion none of this has to do with that that's how I see it's just people readjusting and then some money coming from the sidelines getting put to work that's what I see I love it yeah that's that's that's why I was asking the question cuz I actually agree with what you're saying they're following the stock right you see the stock rise and they they come up with their reasons why it went up and it's not necessarily because they actually believe in the story per se and and that's why I'm so adant about trying to at least put the disclaimer to be careful because if it was for the ladder the oh they are an AI company oh they are going to be the first a truly Sol autonomy then I would say these levels are real or when we get to 400 it's real meaning it's got a nice solid foundation under that stock price but right now it feels more like we got a bunch of pillows under that stock price and it can keep us up we can even go higher and it may not go down but it's not like having you know block construction under that and that that's my my fear right let me ask the question a separate way so that when I first asked the question I was referring to the broader group of investors whether they see a a different view of what Tesla is you're right everything you said I love it how about the this just us how about us as retail investors Are we more confident in our kind of a view of the bullish future for Tesla right so number one in the last earnings call we all heard Elon and you know ashak himself say that we think we're going to get to as safe as a human by mid quarter next year we're going to launch robot taxi paid robot taxi in two states next year now of course this is just you know a company making these projections in the future but there's an extra confidence now that okay it looks like that even these um you know Ash Al Swami who's you know who's somebody we we kind of feel like wouldn't necessarily you know just be boasting about something that may not happen he's trying to give you a real much more real kind of estimate of what he is he himself are saying that this is the case right so that's that's one that we feel like hey that's actually you know more confidence on our side then this other side which is okay you've got these administrators coming in that are pro autonomy that are uh they're talking about a federal framework for you know some sort of autonomous cars so that's another but I I always said that that actually is a small thing I I don't think that's a big thing but it seems like the public feels like that's a really big deal but it's just another thing another potential obstacle that's is being removed so is your your own confidence for the success of robot taxi and the time frame for robot taxi not whether it's going to happen or not it will it's a matter of when does that give you the confidence as well and then of course you know anytime they make the announcement that there's going to increase the compute power of Giga Texas and I don't know if you guys saw this but xai is going to have buy another 100,000 Nvidia and in that that article it talked about that that they might use XI Colossus for FSD it's like what anyways that part I we don't know if that's real or not but these things are happening 100,000 more that's eyew watering that's a whole lot of compute that is uh going to create a power demand that is uh the size of a small City for sure interesting and where's that located again Georgia Memphis Memphis Tennessee yeah that's that's a lot of juice do we know what xai is hoping to tackle with that that's what I just said I mean obviously they're going to do the you know solving the universe's questions but uh but they also apparently going to use it for FSD again I don't know if that's true but that was U part of the comments okay yeah I don't think they're going to use it I don't think so either I think I think they're going to be pursuing their own separate thing yeah sorry yeah what about uh Dojo chip design what are we thinking on that because from what I understand uh I had asked a IBM chip designer senior chip designer I met at CES I said uh I said can you can you share any secrets and he said of course not and I said what about Dojo that's not an IBM secret can you share that and he saides because that's not my company and I can tell you because I've studied it because it was my job to uh look at it and analyze it for the company and also because I find it fascinating I said my question is why is it taking so long to get out into the world because at the time it hadn't been deployed yet and he said it's not that long this is a normal development cycle they just announced it earlier than others would have uh and he said the the fact that they've gotten as far as they have means that they've probably got a second version of it already well into development because that's how it works they're always designing two three chips ahead uh so um I think uh I think what they've done is put together a team that is Irreplaceable the number of people who design chips at that level is small enough that they all know each other uh and I'm curious what you guys think of the future of the chip development and if the market will ever recognize the value of it so pretty much everybody makes their own chips these days um Apple does Amazon does Google does uh Tesla does Microsoft does Microsoft um I don't think that what matters is the design of the chips I mean truly all all that does is help you get more vertically integrated more than anything and maybe um at least from a hyperscaler perspective from a Tessa perspective um I think it's a lot more Nuance because they're designing the chips to be extremely myopically focused rather than able to do all sorts of tasks all they care about is video training um at least with the V1 of Dojo um I don't have a lot of thoughts on it to be honest um it'll be interesting to see what the development is of it I do think that they've been sandbagging their Ambitions with it just to ju just like they were s i I think they're sandbagging what they want to do with the 4680 and what it means and they're always talking about how you know they're still going to buy all the chips or all the batteries they can from any suppliers I think they're still going to say same thing about Nidia um so I I don't know I I don't it's interesting but I don't think I think sometimes we get so focused on these um little topics and they're interesting right for for the Nerds out there like us but I think it's more so what do they mean what's the bigger picture what is this unlock that we're not seeing right it's I think that's the beauty of of um what Elon does is he creates these products and next thing you know somehow here we have a new Revenue Source from this right like SpaceX they didn't start off with the ambition for starlink and then next thing you know here starlink and that's like even the bigger part of it they didn't start off with ambitions of having the Rockets land they were just trying to get Rocket up into the air and you know that that was it so I think Dojo is going to be one of those and I don't think think we know what what what's what's going to come from it yet I think it'll be something that we're not even thinking about uh so I will pivot to starlink because that's a great story right there uh Gwen Shotwell said she expects that by the end of this year so like next month starlink will be profitable and my thought on that is my goodness have you spent a fortune there are 6,000 satellites in orbit to get us to this level and of course starlink uh employment is growing rapidly I think it was just a couple days ago Herbert you posted in our Northwest group that uh Western Washington is sold out it is no longer available the all of the cells are sufficiently saturated that they can deploy no more until you know the next round of a whole lot more satellites get up there and what we're what I'm seeing with that is everybody wants to have a constellation like this but if you need to launch 6,000 satellites how are you going to do that uh are you going to hire SpaceX to do it because you'll have to pay a markup you're not going to get profitable as quickly unless you're charging substantially more and I know we're talking about Tesla and not SpaceX but the ecosystem is all intertwined um when when the astronauts rolled out on the Launchpad for the first crude Mission back to the International Space Station they did it in model axis it was all over the news it was on every channel and everyone was excited and searches for how to invest in SpaceX went through the roof and the answer is you can't but the next day Tesla stock popped because it is an ecosystem had today's launch been a disaster had it blown up the Launchpad or crashed into the ground or anyone hurt at all I believe Tesla stock would have taken a dip on that because investor sentiment it's all one and the same for a lot of people thoughts I'll just add a comment let Herbert give his thoughts um just for awareness Amazon is using SpaceX to launch their Kyper satellites but but but they were gonna use blue origin until the lawsuit went went I don't know if you saw the lawsuit but they went out to bid from all the major launch providers except for SpaceX and I think the investors dud because what are you doing just get the satellites up there and use the cheapest provider yeah so this is an example right I I know why you brought it up which is things that Elon companies are doing they're these Grand ideas and then somehow some of them many of them uh they become come to fruition with an incredible business plan business unit that then succeeds right here's one example so the beautiful thing about Tesla is that they're not just one idea they have 20 business units I think I did a interview with CERN Basher and he identified 14 revenue streams you know and uh so the the the idea that these all these ideas we talked about Dojo as one potential thing that could come to fruition and it's looking like at this point that it's actually now um head in the right direction and it is something we're still saying way up in the future but could turn out to be a positive and it turn out to be that it's actually going to be a GameChanger so these things are happening and um you know so that's why I'm saying what has changed in Tesla are put it this way are we still really the same story today which is Tesla is a car company Tesla is an energy company and someday it will have autonomy and that's what matters whether or not autonomy happens or doesn't that's what this that's what will change Tesla forever otherwise we're still the same companies as we have been for the last three years yeah I mean I I don't think we're a different company other than we are further down the timeline uh oh hey oh no oh no I ha the stream again what's happening the Tesla Gods heard us ladies and gentlemen ladies and gentlemen Yan from Tesla fix is joining us all the way from Germany so good to have you we are discussing uh SpaceX we are discussing Tesla we are discussing Dojo FS autonomy robotics all of it uh what should we ask him jent yeah well yeah I guess where I'm headed here yeah go ahead no no no no please please just goad so let let me I'll ask you this question which is we were talking about what what has changed in Tesla that is now changed it so that it's headed in this new direction right and I think maybe it's not one thing maybe it's like a lot of things that are coming together I wanted to point this out which is quite interesting at you know you guys might have seen this which is just a recent thing Tesla's lowered their model y starting least price in the US to $299 per month and it's the same lease price as model 3 so yeah it could just be a promotion it is just a promotion maybe it's just taking the $7,500 EV tax credit and loading it in maybe it's just them trying to boost up their sales right just to boof up sales to get to the end quarter and so forth and that's what this is but I like what farza was saying here if you look at some of this you know expect this was in response to a new promotion a new thing that Tesla is doing in Texas where they're now offering unlimited charging for $5 per month okay if you do it at nighttime pay five bucks a month you can do unlimited charging if you buy a new Tesla this this week and you sign up in Texas for their energy program now you can lease a car for 200 bucks a month of course this is a lower version of car you can pay a monthly fee $5 for charging you can have your insurance for $100 $1 a month and then he's throwing in at some point they might offer you unsupervised self-driving for $300 a month so now you got $600 a month for completely worry-free unsupervised self-driving ownership experience this is something that might come in in a future which is now they're switching to a subscription model so just wanted to bring that up which is you know this idea that as you see these things forming are is it a stretch for us to think that this is the future a subscription pricing that um that's just of revolutionize kind of car ownership and in fact not only will it be a lower amount at some point it could actually be a revenue stream for you yeah I think that's highly interesting I wanted to touch on two points here you've uh mentioned before that what has changed with Tesla or is it multiple things that change with Tesla for me funny enough because I've also observed Tesla for a long time now is actually the the plan that was laid out long time ago comes diff fruition more and more obviously the timelines were off like with FSD like Elon Musk said FSD robot taxies will be available so yeah I think for 5 years already now I think so um that didn't come to fruition so fast but still it's it's just the plan that that aligns now and and um the levers that Tesla now has also to promote the vehicle as well is insanely competitive in comparison to the rest of the industry because they don't have these levers and now what you've mentioned here is actually even a glimpse into way more into the future is the subscription model because that's right they can do the pricing model can be very yeah creative in that sense and it makes sense because people most of the time spend around $600 for their cars per month also in Germany around 700 or or500 it depends so this is also an area where people are comfortable of spending uh for their car or for their transportation uh per month and uh yeah this means a lot more revenue or um being more competitive for Tesla as well even when people like other companies catch up so it's a tough game I think for legacy car manufacturers right now even more than before but yeah that's my opinion on that there was a program we saw about a year ago and I assume it's still around where you could charge your EV overnight in Texas for I think $10 a month or $20 a month it's now $5 well right but what I mean is there were things on that list that were not real I was just pointing out that this one is real um there uh though the other things could absolutely come I think when FSD is solved uh I think what I'd love to see is forget safety scores I I want a different price differential for when I'm driving versus when it's driving it's already happening so not where we live yeah and Jeff Lut in Chicago uh has Tesla insurance and his price was at $1300 a month for the insurance but as he started using FSD like 99% of the time his Tesla Insurance fell to $100 a month and he was just pointing out that that that insurance reduction is equivalent to the cost of FS D and so they they recognize that if you use FSD more they're going to lower your insurance so ironically USA my insurance has gone up right well I've heard Florida rates are pretty unreasonable well USA well yes but USA has um like this just like a lot of these car companies have or insurance companies have where they track on your phone my score has gotten worse with FSD so okay well I want to bring it right back to the beginning of the conversation because you you guys pushed back when I said has Tesla changed forever well one of the things that has changed since the last earnings call was margin positive right margin the the cost of cost of goods fell margins is starting to be stabilized and grow when Tesla is able to stabilize that margin they're able to offer all of these promotions they have all sorts of levers that they can pull and these things are finally here that they can then truly disrupt a lot of Industries not just the Auto industry but as one example one thing I would point out you you demon you demon uh one thing I would point out is in the past few years we've seen substantial inflation but what we've seen from Tesla is lower cost of goods sold and a reduction in retail price to match uh which is pretty uh exciting and uh actually considering the volume could be one of the reasons the uh inflation index is coming down what I was going to say though is yes we had a good quarter when it comes to margins it will be interesting to see how this next quarter looks when we don't only have the Cyber beast and we are you know baking in FSD and all that completely into it because every cyberbeast had it so like yes you're right Herbert but let's just see this smoothed out over time and not just a one uh blip in the radar okay good point so just being cautiously optimistic I hate to be the person who has to do this but I wna yeah yeah but here here's an example let me let me oh so yeah let me pull that off sah hide. comment and so take a look at this example here Elon replied to somebody who said right hey it' be nice if we had larger vehicles and he said because we have you know in this case the I think it was a uh he was a rabbi that had seven children and Elon goes that's great to see Tesla Robo van is in development some other things too so it's looking like that Tesla is now in an offensive they're able to build more Vehicles they've got two new vehicles coming up next year and they're going to have more different kinds of vehicle formats so again it just feels like because we are now at a stage where a lot of things have formed the economy specifically is also it's another big thing that has changed that lets Tesla to be even much more in the offensive now and Building Things launching things reducing prices everywhere let's say for a second the Tesla is a car company the Juniper refresh is coming out Yan what do you think that's going to do to the sagging sales in Germany and Europe so I would say that they probably will go up um but I'm not 100% sure it's it's a diff it's a diff difficult call I think a new model always ramps up sales and um I think the model 3 Performance was perceived very well by the media here so because if you go heads tohe heads with BMW and the other competitors that are more in the sporty um category um then yeah people will notice that because on RAC tracks like Germans are crazy for that as well so I think this one was a good move also the the refresh model 3 was actually pretty nice it was so nice that even I bought one so I I had to do it then um I think it was perceived pretty well and with the model y refresh I think also that it's it just makes sense to to because Germany is also the Hub of producing those and I think that would be very interesting to see how they will implement it if they will produce it here of course they have to and they wouldn't just uh produce two models from Germany and from Shanghai so there might be a model y Juniper built in Germany it has to so I I'm very interested how this will be perceived and I think it just makes sense because also in Germany the pricing is going up and up and um the you you notice that people's spending here is not as good as before the year before generally that's a a perception I have all around me as well so so people are more hesitant also because of the conflicts that are right next to us so I think people are more cautious with spending and in the end the competitors don't have a good match so in the end uh what choice do you have but to buy a model y then I think the sales will go up then when Juni is released yeah absolutely what's you guys expectation uh what will happen happen when Tesla releases these new vehicles I think most of us agree that Juniper won't necessarily do anything but what about the next vehicle like this the they say they reveal a new vehicle now it could just be a kind of like a revision or a change to an existing model y because it's on the same production line or could be a brand new vehicle but once they release that and say hey that's available for sale what's going to happen it uh you know if it comes out soon uh it'll fill some Gap in the market whe if it's a new vehicle entirely you know it could be based on the three or Y but larger or smaller if it's a completely different form factor like that uh it will increase sales I believe it would cut into the segments of somebody else who's making cars that shape I think that would absolutely juice the sales sub stantially and as quickly as they could ramp it and there are people who just always want the newest Tesla or people who want one of each in their collection I've met a number of those at events around the country around the world and uh I think those people would buy one just for the sake of having one nobody else yeah I I just wanted to wait if Nico wants to say something so because my speaking time is always a little bit uh over the charts uh but I think uh it depends on the form factor obviously if the form factor is a small car I'm still rooting for that for Germany because we will or for Europe because we still have this in between step because the US has the beta test of FSD already rolled out um with supervised still but without touching the steering wheel and China is next so Europe with their regulations will take ages until they get to the point point to finally allow something like this so I estimate that it will take at least 4 years until we are close to something that that uh resembles an fstd legislation more or less so uh because every um yeah every every state or every um country in Europe has to get vote on this and yeah this like the process is just way longer than in the US I think and um that's why I think the in between step would be very very necessary or they lower the price of the model 3 in the end or they get into into a territory where they say okay good that that's our smaller car kind of the M three we focus on that to just cut the costs even more that could make sense but I think even the form factor is it like in Europe we still need smaller cars and I think an in between step would be nice uh but I don't know if they will do it I'm a little confused since the um robot taxi was um pushed for like earlier Elon did say that it's going to they're shooting for $30,000 after incentives didn't he say that uh for the model 3 or the no the new models yeah okay okay no I didn't catch that yeah but but which means that it's going to be a compact car right it's like it's not like it's going to be a yeah that makes sense okay I missed that I thought he said that on the robot taxi like 25,000 I think so I was a little confused there but I think it's maybe Loosely based on that if if there's something in the works this should make sense yeah even a two-seater it it just makes sense just put a SE whe into the robotex that wouldn't make sense for Germany I think people are asking that question what do you guys think about that is that a potential I don't think so asking about what could would they create a cyber Cav without with the p pedals and steering wheel I know you've answered that question before Brian it's um I I I've answered that my my statement is that NV 91 was cancelled that was the Cyber cab with wheels and pedals uh a wheel and pedals um and it is a substantially different vehicle they could make it they would just have to reopen the NV 91 project and spend a year or so on the engineering for it to uh get it up to valid Val ation spec um and they didn't they canceled that anybody else wish to agree or disagree I I go ahead I was just gonna say I'm I kind of think that there's a chance that we will see a new version of the Tesla like we've been talking about this m range version but I could see a world where that's not targeted for Europe or the states where it's targeted for India for China for South America for areas where maybe FSD won't be the primary place or where um you have just lower wages in general so affordability is a lot more difficult and in places like North America and Europe and populated areas of China that that's where they will just do a just oversaturation of of Tesla caps um but I do think that there will be a another version I don't think it'll be the Cyber cab at all yeah with pedals or steering wheel it's going to be a iteration of a three and why I mean we know this like yeah they've told us this it's on the same lines it's it's going to be very reminisent of that and they probably will still sell in Europe and in North America but in my mind what would be a clever idea would be Force the Nar force force the the regions to adopt cyber caps by not selling those Vehicles there and use those more affordable vehicles to go into areas like India South America less populate areas of China to data collect and you know so so that's kind of how I would be thinking about it so to that I want to add something because um on average in Germany people earn for example 55k a year that's on average so they their spending for a car is mostly um or or how they acquire cars is mostly company cars that's that's a main thing that they do I think 60% of car sales are company cars in Germany which is huge and um also people tend to spend more like lower prices on on used cars obviously new cars the new car segment is yeah it's it's there but but I think still people are Ted to buy a lower entry point in uh in car sales there so I think it just I it wouldn't make sense to just sell a cheaper car just in India or in uh yeah or in the other so I disagree there but um what I could see because you say it it will be probably based on the model 3 or the model y on the same line and everything I think it makes sense if they have a Tesla with a different wheelbase that is just smaller because um that's a very popular form fact in Europe anyway so also for China there are some parts that yeah they also use tinier cars in Japan think about Japan too they love smaller cars so the form factor is very popular in not just only Europe or China also in Japan and there are different countries that um where this could make sense also from the pricing Point as well so if if yeah if te Tesla could just tackle that segment I mean this would be very huge for Fiat for like a huge problem for Fiat for Ford for VW um and for that yeah and for that matter they could make it a few inches narrower because uh other countries don't have the same abundance of obesity that we have um we are a nation where the diabetes is loadbearing it's structural and we need to Foster that but in other in other markets why couldn't you make it a couple inches narrower if you look at something like the um uh Mitsubishi imv IM uh when they imported that to the US they literally had to make it 4 in wider uh because us occupants are a little bulkier than their Japanese counterparts I could see boy if you just took a couple like just take the whole thing down by a couple percent make it just a few inches narrower a few inches shorter that would end up being a whole lot of atoms that would uh reduce the weight significantly you could drop the battery pack from 75 to maybe 65 kwatt hours and then you get this Cascade where you've got cheaper brakes cheaper tires cheaper Wheels cheaper suspension and that could introduce quite a bit of savings D yeah I I think I get I get what you're saying about the need for it and all that my point is to force those regions to adopt cyber cabs to press them to lean into FSD would be that Force mechanism of no we're not going to sell you or not going to sell these vehicles to those regions because it's to data technology for those regions right Europe has really great streets great road signs great I mean the infrastructure there is really good it's same with you know in in North America it's not the same in South America it's not the same in parts of China it's not the same in India so in those regions it makes sense that the the cities that The environments those countries haven't really caught up in general I mean like in South America when you're driving the lanes are suggestions lights are suggestions people aren't actually bued by it like it's not like that in Europe exactly you know it's um but so I think those are great areas where you could force force the narrative to go into robot taxis and I think that would be the way to do it I don't think you would need to force them I think in in markets where they can't afford even a $20,000 car uh that the motivation would already be there to use something that costs you know five bucks a ride 10 bucks a ride so I I don't think they're going to do this I think uh what they want they don't need to make smaller cars at this point what they'll want to make is a car that's roomy inside even if you're a small individual because it's going to become robotaxi you want to have a lot of room to be you know exp the experience and relaxation inside so just like what Nick was saying it's pretty clear at this point right they're creating the robot the Cyber cab and that is designed for robotaxi they're not going to put a steering wheel and pedal on that as some people have said they're creating these new vehicles that's based on a Model 3 Model y that's what's going to bring down the price to sub $30,000 I don't think they're going to make them smaller I think they're just going to you know because they're going to all be eventually uh robotaxis and eventually you will sell the Cyber Cab in Europe in India and China as a robo taxi and so that's your two form small two form two seater form factors that's going to solve that you that solution yeah but my question there is if there is a market for smaller cars what do you do with the five years that you could have sold a different model until FSC is ready in Europe are you saying that the smaller car it has to be a smaller car not just that the price is the same as a smaller car it depends South Europe yeah you need smaller cars in Germany it's a little different people are used to little like sedans or middle class cars from the size perspective if you had a Model A little little conf that was priced at 25 Grand yeah the pricing is a lot does a lot with that sure but in the south of Europe I think South Europe like like Italy for example or Spain or yeah H yeah I have to think about that more it's interesting topic to to think about that if they need we'll just sit here and wait okay we're not actually waiting this year is not the year where uh Tesla's change forever is NE is it next year and what is it that we're talking about is it only just Robo taxi that Robo taxi is real it's proven that's it or is there anything else that could happen like I've been trying to say here mult multiple vehicles but more importantly the pricing of the vehicles it's not just that the Tesla is a car company but if they can change the subscription model they can change the the kind of how how much money you'd have to pay so small and they combine all these features that that could be a a complete disruption of the industry just that alone I would say that yeah you go first Nick okay well I I would say that uh forget uh forget cars entirely yes if Robo taxi is deployed if Optimus is deployed forget Tesla changing the world changes I think Tesla I agree with that Brian uh but I think Tesla will Tesla will always be Tesla but what will change once re taxis arrive how many people have you met that say yeah it's all right T yeah they look cool they're interesting but once they buy it or once they experience it it's like whoa with Robo taxis that would be the first time the barrier to entry to experience or use a Tesla product is available to everybody no matter of what your tax bracket is that will be gamechanging and at that point The Narrative will I think have really changed for Tesla agree entirely butts and seats is the biggest motivator I was hanging out with a friend who's a big EV fan he loves Tesla but he doesn't have one he's never driven one and I asked him if he'd like to drive mine and he no no I know what would happen if I did and I was like yes you do yes you do I also talked to somebody who um never had a electric vehicle before for and we just talked about the Tesla and I said yeah m 3 is so nice uh when I just walk up to it it opens up and I I told the um usability of the of the car of the model 3 um Highland refresh there and yeah couple I think four months later he arrived with a model 3 and with a performance version in the kindergarten where I um drop off my kid and it was funny to see then he said like I never used an electric car before he never even test drove mine so he just went there and kind of bought it blind the same way I did it because he was so because he watched some videos and he was so astonished by it and yeah that's it it has an effect like everybody I talk to especially those who who went from dinosaurs uh or dinosaur techn dinosaur juice technology to to uh the the Teslas are are stunned and also everybody that tested an ID three wanted to go back to hybrids or internal combustion engine cars which is pretty funny yeah now you see kind of the Gap where where where both products or or visions kind of separate because when you think of EVS the best ones are actually the tesas in my opinion I'm highly biased in that sense but yeah my opinion here I don't that's an opinion I think that's been actually proven by all sorts of people all sorts of agencies all sorts of testers the fact that the model 3 Highland in all its variations in all its variants get such Universal a claim from critics who in the past have even been quite skeptical uh tells you kind of everything you need to know there there are of course Outlets who will say nice things no matter what or or who never say anything bad about any car but most of the Publications have no problem uh telling you your car is not good enough and the model 3 Highland is amazing and I expect the Juniper to be a carbon copy but a little bit larger just like we just like the the Y was to the original Three yeah and one thing I want to add here because I think it's important here I think the perception of electric cars in general in Germany I know it's it's sad that I always talk about this but but and that I use this as a surrogate for whole of Europe but um it's interesting to see that the perception of electric cars went down because everybody Germans are very loyal to VW for example now they have the ID3 now they want to go back to hybrids but then they have now this uh this experience with the m fre Highland was there and then they have the performance version of the model 3 Highland and that was very important because that wanted people to test drive also the model 3 again kind of but with the sporo version I think it's for Germany it's the best strategy to go with the performance versions to get butts in the seats in that sense because generally uh electric cars are perceived a little yeah disappointing and but they need to test drive the performance version and that's how you get pressed in Germany is when you have the performance versions around and beat the German car companies there yeah good okay thank you everybody so stay on you can uh be automatically transferred to Future oza he's going to answer all the questions that's uh showed up on the chat there thanks everybody show up again next week talk to you soon bye bye"

        "transcript": "case you missed it yesterday Kim Kardashian posts on X meet my new friend tagging Tesla and apparently she was hanging out with Tesla's humanoid robot okay hi can you do this I love you you know how to do that okay what should we do go running let's go for a run do you know how to do oh you are Hawaiian okay and as I watched Kim Kardashian interacting with warmly I might add Tesla's humanoid robot posting to her audience of hundreds of millions of people on social media talk about some Free Press free exposure I was reminded of this very intelligent form of sentient hair gel who maybe two months ago had this to say I think by the way this was leaked footage for possession with his therapist I'm not exactly sure I don't know how it ended up on a but anyway let's see what he had to say go around to your neighbors and ask them how many of you would buy a humanoid robot built by Elon Musk and the answer is zero okay nobody wants a robot from Elon Musk why who would trust it okay okay hi can you do this I love you you know how to do [Music] that so a nice slow clap and now Jim Kramer who hasn't been featured on this channel for [ __ ] a long time sharing some thoughts on Tesla and possibly even autonomy some stories are just too good to be true and that's how I feel about the possibility of a federal Proclamation that leads to a Nationwide roll out of fully self-driving cars Tesla's stock was up again today because we're getting reports that President elect Trump who is an a valid climate change Deni has cast his lot with Elon Musk to develop national self-driving Vehicles it's pretty clear that Trump doesn't see the need for electric in fact he want send any subsidies including tax credits for manufactur them however he did state I'm going to quote here I'm for electric cars I have to be because you know Elon endorsed me very strongly end quote I just got to take a moment to add some important context here this was a tongue-in cheek comment from Trump just to be clear right he's a funny guy I suspect given Kramer's early comments Trump is an avowed climate change denier and the network that disappears on cnbs almost exclusively lean left shout out to Joe one of the few exceptions they may be trying to paint this as almost some kind of corrupt unfair treatment type of scenario well he endorsed me therefore that's not the case it was a tongue and cheek comment just want to put that out there in case Jim's trying to suggest something here possibly part of the narrative that his overlords demand which is orange man bad little transactional for me look I'm not I'm not against owning Tesla you know that I just think that this is a bad reason Elon mus tells a very compelling story about full self-driving as well as solar robots all wrapped up in the one stock of a company that happens to make vehicles but the idea that the White House can somehow allow self-driving cars everywhere with the stroke of a pen that's just plain fanom first our country simply doesn't work like that we have state and local governments with tremendous power to block at anything I remember when I was going to be able to take a self-driving taxi from Downtown Phoenix to Glendale the home of the Arizona Cardinals a couple years ago for the Super Bowl it seems so simple except Glendale didn't allow self-driving vehicles I was incredulous but the municipal government of Glendale was able to block us second you might think it's natural for Trump to just declare the federal interstate highway system at self-driving Zone but you know what that's meaningless too think about it how do you get on the interstate highway system other than a few municipalities that may be designated on some map someday it's catches catch Ken the can't control state or local self self-driving laws if they try it those municipalities will sue the Federal Highway Administration and they're going to win okay well I mean there we have it folks Jim Kramer just predicted who will win wait what's this what are we looking at here this is a post on X from October 12th Jim Kramer predicts carela Harris will win the presidential election quote I don't see how he Trump wins meanwhile some guy with three first names posted a final election prediction Trump wins by Landslide nailed it wins a popular vote nailed it wins all swing States nailed it and it's a crushing overwhelming Victory Nailed It Anyway this slight detour has absolutely nothing to do with Jim Kramer's prediction that the states will win I don't even know why I mentioned it there was another time in this country when a president might have been able to do something about this in the 1950s President Eisenhower planned and execute of the interstate highway system but he did that for National Defense reasons in those days we had a cold war with the Soviet Union as an overarching imper in our nation which made the interstate highway act a much easier sell well I wasn't expecting it to be this funy then again it is cnvs anyone want to guess who KR voted for so first of all taking a swipe at Trump's tongue in cheek comment about having to support Tesla now because of the endorsement I me God damn it Jim's a smart guy surely he actually knows that was tongue and cheek right but he's just trying to paint orange man bad as orange man bad then all this [ __ ] or it's not going to be able to happen blah blah blah blah blah then he goes on to point out a historical precedent where something like this was able to get p through and he points out well you know Cold War national security issue why is it a national security issue because people might die hello uh wait you know what else dies people in cars when they crash and if you carve out just a chunk of people who are dead permanently injured or disabled in preventable human error caused accidents just in the United States alone when the safety profile of a Tois Vehicles proven through mountains of data can show XYZ lives saved permanent injuries and disability prevented no one is standing in the way of that I mean if I didn't know any better I think this guy owned Ford stock or something I'm not saying that he does I'm just you know like why else it's a weird thing to say right in the us alone in a typical year give will take 40 45,000 people die in accidents almost all of them preventable almost all of them caused by human error it's like 100 people per day a few people per hour dying just in the United States probably at least 10 times as many severe injuries and permanent disabilities who in their right mind would stand in the way of the deployment of demonstrably safer autonomous vehicles what is Jim smoking still I like the concept that that there's what Barclay calls an Elon premium to me Tesla deserves the premium musk has no doubt influenced the president-elect to scrap the $7,500 clean vehicle credit which will make it much harder for legacy automakers to ever compete with Tesla so fact check false musk is on the record going back a number of years saying this tax credit should be scrapped before Trump had even announced he was running let alone began campaigning for 2024 let alone being endorsed by Elon okay I'm going to say that again Elon is on the record going back multiple years saying that the tax credit should be scrapped subsidies for the fossil fuel industry also scrapped the way that Jim's presenting this it's as if Al's well you know what uh this will [ __ ] our competitors really hard if we get rid of the tax credit now that we're buddies Trump so let's get rid of it so [ __ ] our competitors don't get me wrong if it goes away Tesla soal competition is [ __ ] and it should go away but this is not a new idea that must has come up with that he's suddenly now hanging out with Trump at UFC therefore you can ask for favors he's on the record going back years saying that this thing should go away CR is math ain't mathing here we're going to hear from foron Jim CFO at a conference on Wednesday and we'll learn how their electric divisions can handle the end of those tax credits I believe GM can handle it but Ford well they may be stuck in neutral waiting for the warranty issues to dissipate if they ever can in the end while I don't buy the national self-driving mandate I think nothing truly dos the case for owning Tesla the must premium will work its magic in other ways perhaps favorable municipalities and Tesla rentals next to Federal highways no matter what though always remember that Tesla's a tech company the others are automakers and a tech company can get an insanely high price joury multiple with no one blinking so much as an eye about it at least Kramer is correctly identifying Tesla as a technology company although AI would be a little bit more accurate so just to recap the World According to Jim Kramer on cnbs who lean heavily to the left Trump's corrupt elon's self-interested a federal framework for the approval of autonomous vehicles won't actually make any difference whatsoever cuz the states will just block it it's not like this is a major situation where tens of thousands of people die every year so it's not like they can kick the door and say [ __ ] off leave us alone this needs to happen Elon has miraculously suddenly now become best friends with Trump and therefore instantaneously after the fact decided that the heav tax credit should go away and if you happen to see evidence of musk saying this for years is you must have imagined it it must be misinformation but that said Tesla's a tech company and the Stock's great and you should probably Own It Anyway I think that's the gist of what he had to say what a mixed bag and before I wrap up today just wanted to remind everybody Tesla stock currently $346 per share market cap almost $1.1 trillion over the past 12 months up nearly 50% and since a closing price in April of $142 per share up nearly 150% more than 2 $200 per share gained since April 2024 wait did somebody say April 2024 what's this what are we looking at on screen now number of Tesla shares held in some atfs including the fund managed by the guy who said who would buy a bot from Elon Musk who would trust that guy no one let me see here I just want to so which one is the the sentient hair gel oh the Orange is the sentient hair gel okay so oh I see the money the fund managed by the guy in the suit with severe TDS and EDS held just over 8,000 shares of Tesla stock mid 2023 sold that position down to less than 1,000 shares of Tesla stock in oh what do you know April 2024 wait April 2024 all right yeah congratulations you [ __ ] idiot now some of you might think Stephen come on you're being a little bit harsh it's true the reason is cuz this [ __ ] was in the media lying he called Elon Musk a white supremacist anti-semite these types of comments saying who would trust the guy attacking the guy's character his fair game he [ __ ] around and he found out what an absolute [ __ ] why would anybody trust him to manage their money and by the way I actually know the answer to that if you too have severe Trump derangement syndrome and therefore severe Elon derangement syndrome because orange man bad and since Elon supported orange man bad that means Elon bad therefore Elon bad he's the perfect guy to obliterate your capital in fact fact there was a great comment on this video I posted on X earlier ah here we go this one Ross is taking his Fe by the way you got to be watching this fuery dudy very seriously posted by some guy called SMR 420 as I posted 10 out of 10 comment I wish I thought of it oh wait what now I don't want to be unfair so I'm not just going to roast the guy for dumping Tesla stock like [ __ ] hell dude I mean so selling shares like crazy I mean the data I don't have anything past here in the media saying Elon bad Elon distracted blah blah blah blah blah neck minute stocks up over $200 per share 6 months later not even but that's not fair because it's an ETF right there's a bunch of other shares that may have massively outperformed the market and I'm not going to be sneaky and pick a particular time frame right that would be unfair I'm not going to try and paint a false narrative so let's just go back to day one for the GK ETF and see how it's performed from day one all time that's the best approximation we have for performance right you can't judge it over 2 weeks or or 3 months or 6 months right let's go back to the day it launched wonderful up 12 oh that's red oh that's a negative symbol oh that's uh that's huh it's down 12.18% since starting that's awkward but hey look maybe maybe the overall markets are down in that situation you'd be completely Justified for a negative return right cuz your goal is to just outperform let's say the benchmarks maybe the S&P 500 so if the S&P is down over that same time frame by 20% Then you know they've done okay so the GK ETF launches the 2nd of July 2021 okay so S&P 500 433 72 on that same date today up a me 36.1% now I'm not very good at math here so maybe you guys can help me out 36 and then you got the 12 so that' be about 48 49 nearly 50% differential underperformed the S&P by roughly 50% since launch I mean look I'm not trying like I said I'm not trying to be deceptive can't go back any further I am a long-term investor I mean I still don't think it's that fair comparing over just a few years but I thought the point of paying somebody to manage your money was to out perform right isn't it I mean I don't pay anyone to manage my money I'd rather do it myself now looking fairness maybe 10 years from now the GK ETF if it still exists will have massively outperformed the indexes but as of today that is awkward for context Tesla 2nd of July 2021 same date 226 bucks a share up nearly 53% now obviously Tesla's been very volatile if i' had been recording this a couple of months ago Tesla down 35% from that date or Worse late December early January down 50% but I mean all I can do is tell you guys from today as I record this how things look that's got to hurt and I want to be clear guys I'm not roasting Ross for the sake of roasting Ross I mean bro the guy's got such a severe case probably incurable terminal of sand in vagitus brought upon by severe TDS and now Elon endorses orange man bad therefore now Elon bad he's gone point of no return it's over he's not going to recover he's got full Sam Harris now right it's over gone I'm not roasting him for the sake of roasting him I'm roasting him to point out what happens when you as an investor let your emotions Cloud your judgment save your emotions for your therapy sessions I don't even know what a therapy session is like I'm going presume that's where you let it all out keep them the [ __ ] out of your investing okay otherwise you do [ __ ] like this and get roasted relentlessly as a lesson in how not to invest how not to manage money one final question would you trust somebody to manage your money if they can't even manage their emotions worth considering want more content Early Access bunch of

        "transcript": "this is the new 2024 Tesla Model 3 and it's different it may not look all that different but it is the model 3 has been updated with some fairly significant changes its first major revision since it came out almost 7 years ago today I'm going to take you through it I'm going to review the new model 3 and show you all of its quirks and features today's video is brought to you by cars and bids my online Enthusiast car auction site that recently sold this and this and this and this and this check it out at cars and bids.com all right time for the quirks and features of the new Tesla Model 3 Highland except it's not actually called the Highland everybody's been calling it that but when I borrowed this car from Tesla they told me they don't call it the Highland externally in any marketing materials internally it's not called the Highland Tesla literally said to me in an email we don't know where that came from we don't know why people are calling it that so it is not called the model 3 Highland officially or unofficially that's just a name I guess Tesla fans have given it which is certainly an interesting Quirk now on to the rest so you might be thinking new model 3 what exactly is different looks the same as the old one well not up front the front end design has been updated you can see the front face has been changed the headlights have been changed it's a subtle update up here but it is different than the old outgoing model and it looks more modern and same deal in Beck there's no radical redesign here but it is different compared to the outgoing model 3 have a different tail light design a different rear end design in general some subtle tweaks some changes to modernize the look of the car and the badge is different different Tesla is now written across the rear end of the model 3 as opposed to the Big T Tesla badge right in the center that's another difference for the new one and the wheel design has changed too gone as the old Tesla Model 3-wheel very distinctive replaced instead by this one which is new and apparently better for aerodynamics in fact Tesla says that all of these changes while subtle have combined to make this the most aerodynamic Tesla model of all time to improve the drag coefficient to make it even more slippery and aerodynamic and two new paint colors coming to the new model 3 there's Arrow gray which apparently this is looks a lot like the gray on other model 3s but I guess it's new and also stealth red which will be red and stealthy and next up we move inside the updated model 3 where the interior has also been tweaked and revised Tesla says with the goal of impr improving the feel the quality and the premiumness which is an actual word that Tesla used in an email to me explaining what they're changing although I make fun of them for that the truth is they have done a good job of increasing the premium feel in this interior that was always a complaint about the outgoing model 3 it just didn't seem all that nice inside and now they've boosted things and made it better specifically the dashboard you have this new material here on the top which looks and feels nice and this live going around the entire top of the dashboard and continuing down to the door panel it includes both aluminum trim which looks good and a mood lighting element which also looks nice and you can change the color of that to be whatever you see fit but probably the biggest interior change in the new model 3 comes in back we have a new display screen back here a new 8in display touch screen that allows you as the rear passenger to select configure change all sorts of things you have for example movies back here a Entertainment app section with Hulu and YouTube that you can select and then watch movies if you want there's also video games back here as you can see several different titles you can play with a video game controller that comes with the car if you want to do that and you have climate controls back here you can adjust your air temperature fan speed and you even have heated rear seats now for added comfort in the updated model 3 as for other changes to the new model 3 one of them comes to the center screen you still have a Giant Center screen that controls everything like in basically all Tesla models but it's apparently a little bit bigger than before and Tesla says more responsive which will obviously make life easier and then there's the new sound system Tesla says there is a new Next Generation premium sound system available in the latest model 3 with 17 speakers which is a lot of speakers and it should enhance your sound quality in here also in this interior you have dual wireless charging one little charging pad on each side for two phones and USB C ports in these Center Cubbies for more charging of your devices another interesting thing Tesla has eliminated the roll forward mode when the car is at idle in the past you could have the car roll forward to simulate a regular gas powered car with a traditional automatic transmission that's gone now and when you're stopped at idle even in drive the car stops in place but probably the biggest change up front to the new model 3 is the lack of stocks coming off the steering column for the new model 3 the stocks for your windshield wipers turn signals your shifting into gear all that stuff is gone and integrated into other places in the car in the case of the turn signals it's here on the steering wheel you can see button for left button for right you push those and that's how you put on your turn signal if you want to turn on your windshield wipers you tap the windshield wiper button on the steering wheel you can see it here and then it pulls up your windshield wiper controls on the screen and then you select what it is you want various different wiper speeds or just automatic wipers if you want to go into gear and actually drive the car you have two choices no longer a stock but instead get in the car put your foot on the brake and this display appears on the left side of the screen allowing you to drag the car upwards to go forward go into drive or drag the car back backwards to go into reverse that's how you can select gears or if you want a more traditional gear selection situation you have that on the ceiling near the rear view mirror you can barely make out prnd D around the hazard light button that's an old school traditional way where you can shift gears if for example the screen breaks or you just prefer that to swiping your finger and one other function the stocks used to have but no longer is turning on autopilot you used to press the the stock down a couple times autopilot would go on since it's gone now you turn on autopilot with this button here you press it on the steering wheel just one press or you can configure it to be two presses but either way it goes on and turns on autopilot so these functions of the stocks have migrated elsewhere and now the stocks are gone in an effort to increase minimalism in this interior and one other big change for the new model 3 is an intended Improvement in noise reduction Tesla tells me they've added AC ustic glass you can see this double painted glass and made other noise reduction and vibration enhancements to this car to try to make it quieter more comfortable more Supple inside this interior now Tesla tells me that the result is a 30% reduction in wind noise a 20% reduction in road noise a 30% Improvement in noise isolation and a 25% impact in overall noise reduction I have no idea how they measure me those percentages but that's the goal to make the car feel more premium with the materials and with the sound and comfort while you're driving so those are all the new changes to the updated model 3 before I get on to General model 3 quirks and features I want to talk over the two versions of this car that are available there are two trim levels there's a base model with rear wheeel drive it starts around $39,000 it has 272 M of range and it does 0 60 in 5.8 seconds or you can upgrade to the long range model that's this one dual motor because it has all-wheel drive that starts around $47,500 and with the dual motor range jumps to about $340 M on a single charge which is excellent and acceleration drops 0 to 60 in 4.2 seconds now of course the pricing numbers I'm quoting that's before rebates that may be offered by your local or federal government depending on your situation but those are the starting prices before those rebates so those are the basics the updates and changes for the new model 3 now let's move on to General model 3 cirks and features starting with getting inside your phone is a key you do have a key card that comes with this car as a backup but you don't need it you got your Tesla app you walk up to the car you phone's in your pocket you press on the door handle it opens right up and you walk in and the phone app has a lot of great benefits related to the car you can find out where the car is on your phone app you can schedule charging you can mess with security and you can even do various vehicle functions from the app like lock or unlock the doors drop the windows or even honk the horn all of which is neat party tricks but you can see how that stuff would be functional too and once you're inside the model 3 you start to notice a lot of interesting quirks and features for one despite the minimalist nature of this interior the basic Simplicity of this car's overall design it actually has a lot of really fantastic high-tech features let's start with the camera system you put on the turn signal you press that button on the steering wheel and it brings up a blind spot camera which is right in your Center screen so you can see what's in your blind spot making it easier to make a lane change now one drawback about this car's minimalism is the lack of a screen directly ahead of the steering wheel like where gauge cluster would be it'd be nice to see that blind spot camera in that screen but Tesla doesn't offer one like some other brands do so we have it here instead it's still a fantastic feature you don't get on many cars another great feature about the camera system is that you can pull it up with just one tap of this button on the steering wheel press it and then your cameras are up which makes it easier to park or move around in tight spaces a lot of cars have great camera systems better than Tesla but you got to go into various menus to access them a simple tap on the steering wheel and the cameras are up that's great and another great benefit of the camera system in this car is Sentry mode when you park this car lock it and walk away you can arm Sentry mode where the cameras that show you where you're parking suddenly become security cameras that show you if someone comes up to the car and tries to break a window or break in steal something whatever you suddenly have security cameras all on your car which is cool possibly the only drawback of the camera system is the TLA still doesn't have a top down 360° camera in this car which is absolutely wild basically every other automaker is offering this now makes it very easy to maneuver in tight spaces easy to park between the lines or where you want unfortunately Tesla still hasn't figured that one out which is disappointing but next we move on to the other rather interesting Quirk of this car which is that a lot of the adjustments that you see in normal vehicles with switches and buttons are worked with the screen in this car it's very interesting let's start with the mirrors to adjust the mirrors there's no switch on your door panel instead you go into the controls menu you select the mirrors and then this little switch on your steering wheel changes the mirrors you can go left right up down you can see the mirror is changing as I move the switch and you can switch over to the other side mirror and then the same switch will do the same thing just over on the passenger side it's the same deal with adjusting the steering wheel position you go into the steering wheel settings menu in the center screen and then once again this switch will move the steering wheel up and down backwards and forwards so that you can position it exactly where you want rather than a typical switch on the steering wheel it starts in the center screen and it's more than just that you want to turn on your headlights well guess where you go that would be into the screen where you can turn them on there now thankfully you can flash your brights your high beams on the steering wheel which is sometimes a nice feature to be able to have instant access to but your typical headlights are in the screen amazingly this screen control setup even includes your glove box you want to open that you got to go into the screen into the control section and then you press the part of the screen that opens up the glove box and then it opens you don't even have a glove box handle in this car it is that minimalists now the drawback to all of this screen stuff is obviously it complicates some items but it's a lot of stuff you don't use very frequently like your headlights you put them in Auto and the car will kind of take care of the rest you don't really need a button or a switch for them however the climate controls it's a little bit of a different story that you're using very frequently and of course it's integrated into the screen now you have your basic controls down here you can adjust the temperature pretty easily here and you can turn on your heated seats or your front defroster rear defroster all with sort of a simple two-step process but for more climate controls you get you got to press the screen it pulls up a larger menu and then you have more work to do to figure out exactly what it is you want to use it's not a huge disappointment or drawback but it is a little harder to use than other automakers that have integrated their climate controls into the screen where it just takes up a fixed portion of the screen at all times here you got to at least do one tap and then a second tap to do basically anything and a strange myth that this car has when you turn on your heated seats in the climate control setting you turn them on and then it doesn't display play anywhere that they are on now if you're sitting in the driver's seat it seat's getting hot you don't really need the car to tell you that it's on but if your passenger leaves the seat on and then gets out of the car it might just stay heating same deal in the back with no icon to let you know that it's on kind of a weird decision a little disappointing with that said one absolutely fantastic feature of the climate controls is something that Tesla calls dog mode the way this works is you can leave your dog in the car even on a hot day you're going shopping normally that would be a very bad thing it gets hot inside the car and the dog could die but if you put the car in dog mode you can leave the dog inside lock the doors walk away and the car will keep the interior temperature at a reasonable 70 some degrees Fahrenheit to make sure that the the dog stays comfortable even while you're outside the car doing something else and then it even says on the screen while you're away hey the dog is comfortable don't worry it's nice and cool inside the car just so people don't freak out when they see a dog in your car in a hot parking lot it's a neat idea that Tesla came up with where you can lock the doors and still keep the climate control going for your dog's convenience now while it may seem like too many controls are integrated into this screen I did find one cool shortcut that makes life easier if you're sitting in the driver's seat driving the car and you hold down the button on the left side of the steering wheel it pulls up sort of a hidden menu that allows you to adjust various things from the steering wheel using the button you can change the climate control temperature here the fan speed and a wide variety of different stuff pull up the camera even open up the glove box turn on the defroster all from this like quick button press on the steering wheel which is a cool idea now one big drawback in this car to going stock lless and putting all of your controls in the screen is the windshield wiper situation I mentioned to turn on the wipers you press this button on the steering wheel and then you can adjust the setting you want your wipers to be on most people will leave them on automatic except the automatic wipers in this car just aren't all that good it rains quite a bit before they actually start to turn on so you're constantly having to make manual adjustments which isn't that easy when it's not just a simple steering column stock you got to press the wiper thing and then scroll over to the wipers you want and constantly change them up and down it would work great if the auto wipers were better but but they're just not and there's other cool stuff inside this infotainment system display Beyond actual functional things just some fun little quirks and features and Easter eggs that Tesla has hidden in here for example you can change the sound of the horn this is the current horn sound take a [Music] [Laughter] listen okay fine but that is boring you can choose from various different other horn sounds if you'd prefer like for example this indignant British man well I never well I never well I never okay so that's funny and check this out you can also change the color of the display car that is shown in the screen right here right now the car is roughly the color of the one I'm sitting in but you can adjust what color you want it to be and you can even choose between metallic paint solid paint or matte paint if that's what you want to see you can totally change whatever is displayed never really seen that level of configurability for a simple ins screen display car before and of course just like in back up front you can also play games there are video games integrated into this infotainment screen there's even a driving race car game where you use the actual steering wheel of the car to drive around I've showed this in other Tesla videos before the integrated video game system of course you would only do that if the car is parked you're sitting somewhere waiting for someone you're bored well you can play video games in your model 3 and also just like in back there's even a theater setting where you can pull up various different apps you'd use to watch entertaining programs including Netflix Hulu Tik Tock and even YouTube you can watch Doug De Muro review a Tesla from the comfort of your Tesla if that's what you wish now beyond all the technology in this car there is still a few cirks and features worth noting and the rest of the stuff even though it is tremendously minimalist in here for one thing I love the cover over the visor mirrors which doesn't sound like something that you would form a relationship with but it's really cool you open it up and then it's magnetic so you can split it in half so you can have the visor mirror open but the cover isn't getting in your way and it's just a really neat design the way they've created this something that basically every other manufact should follow also worth pointing out you have storage cubbies in the center console here this Center armrest lifts up for storage and the furthest forward compartment also pushes open for storage I also like how this compartment pushes open there's a little tab that comes up over on the right side to push and then the compartment next to it has a tab on the left side to push so they don't Collide makes it easier to open them by the way that other compartment the left side tab that's your cup holders you can open that up and then you can store drinks in here or keep everything closed to really maximize the minimalism and take a look around this interior you will notice there are no climate vents in here there are none at all you don't see them in the traditional places on the dashboard so how does air get into the interior climate air conditioning heat the answer is there is a climate vent but it's hidden under this panel on the dashboard there's one long climate vent that goes all the way through now when I first reviewed the model 3 way back in 2017 I had the very first review I was unsure whether this would be enough to actually get air into the interior to make it warm or cool but it works quite well actually and it's not visible so you can keep the minimalism theme going without sticking climate vents on the dashboard as for climbing out of the model 3 you don't have a traditional door handle like you do in a lot of cars instead there's a button located here on the door pole you press that and then it electronically pops the door open and you can climb out just in case the electronics fail or the battery dies there's also a backup solution a physical mechanical door handle located here next to your power window switches you can pull on that open the door and climb out as well without the electronic mechanism but if you pull on that door handle a little warning comes on the screen and tells you the window trim may be damaged I guess that's because when you get out the traditional way electronically the window drops a little bit to let you out but if you get out the mechanical way it doesn't do that which could over time cause damage to the trim kind of an interesting warning haven't seen that one before as for the trunk the cargo area there's really nothing new here you pop it open it opens up electronically which is a very nice luxury touch and it's not a hatchback despite its long sweeping rear window design the model 3 does have a traditional trunk like a traditional sedan and that continues in the new one but you open up the trunk and you can see it's quite large actually despite this car's look with a kind of stubby rear end it has a large and cavernous cargo compartment where you can stick whatever you want and there's even more space on the side you can see a compartment here for more stuff same deal over on the other side and underneath the floor lift this up and there's actually a fairly large additional compartment where you can put even more stuff and just in case you've maximized all of this cargo space and you still want more you can it up front the front compartment also opens there's a small but relatively sizable front trunk up there where you can put even more stuff for even more storage capabilities finally we move on to the overall design of this car I mentioned what is new but as for what is quirky the answer is well not much the model 3 is intended to be a very generic looking car and it retains that look there's nothing particularly quirky or weird weird or controversial about the way it looks one interesting item though on the outside worth pointing out is this little piece on the fender this is one of the few like style touches that the model 3 has and even that is actually functional that's where the camera is mounted for that blind spot camera that I showed you earlier the one that comes on when you put on the turn signal that's where they mount the camera so even though there's a little style element on the front fender that too has a purpose all right driving the new Tesla Model 3 which I say in an exciting tone but the thing I've learned from driving this car is it is not an exciting car at all you know it does 0 to 60 quickly it's a it's a it's a fast car but so is every electric car now you know there was a time when that was a really cool advantage that Tesla had over other vehicles but now with the proliferation of electric cars we've we're all used to going 0 to 60 in 4 seconds or 3 seconds uh if we spent any time in any sort of higher term electric car and so that in itself does not make this car exciting and other than that the steering and handling is is kind of numb the steering is very quick and I think that Tesla does that to disguise the fact that the handling is not particularly great there's more body roll than you'd want it's not particularly flat around corners uh it's definitely not intended to be a sports car nor is it one I borrowed this car from Tesla for a week and the thing that I've learned driving it around for that time is this is not a a car that you fall in love with it is not a car that elicits an emotional response but it is a truly fantastic car at doing the appliance thing which is how I've why I've titled this video how I did commuting is a mundane task and this car does the best job of maybe any car at making it easy it is just a a a daily annoyance sitting in traffic on the 163 like I am right now made easy because you have autopilot you have a great charging Network you don't have to put an expensive gasoline they created a car that just tackles all of those things and solves for it the car is cheap to buy it is cheap to own factoring out depreciation I'd buy one used uh or would lease one it's cheap to run it's cheap to operate and it makes your life easier when you're driving it around this is not a special car but it is very very very very good at doing what it is supposed to to do which is just point A to point B without complaint making life easier there's no drawbacks except for the fact that it is mind-numbingly boring to look at to drive but honestly even as a car Enthusiast I'm okay with that I think it's totally fine to have a boring Anonymous self-driving car to drive to work every day while you have cool stuff in your garage to take out on the weekends it's been a while since I've been in a model 3 um I get them in as Ubers sometimes but I don't regularly drive one or use one uh it does feel quieter in here it does feel more luxurious and nicer which is honestly good because truthfully uh that was the probably the biggest drawback of the old car it just didn't seem all that nice this car does and the ride feels a little bit softer it just feels a little bit like a little bit nicer car not a full on luxury car by any stretch of the imagination nor would you expect one at this price point Tesla really wants to make this car minimalist inside and frankly I like that I think there's a lot of great things about that um the drawback is some minimalist details are kind of annoying I always felt taking away the heads up display directly in front of the steering wheel it would be nice to see what speed you're going whether your headlights are on what street you're pushing that kind of thing directly ahead of you taking away the stocks makes things even a little bit harder and I'm just not entirely thrilled with that but I will say you do adapt fairly quickly figuring out the turn signals the headlights the wipers getting it into gear all the stuff that used to be on the stocks test Tesla has this autopilot system that most Tesla owners believe is either the only autopilot system in the car industry the only you know driver assist Tech like this or the best I don't feel that way and and driving this car underscores and reminds me why I don't feel that way Tesla autopilot is fantastic especially on the freeways especially in bumper to bumper traffic it's one of the reasons that makes this car such a great commuter you can turn on autopilot and just not really do all that much autopilot is not great on regular surface streets it gets confused by Lane line frequently and has trouble distinguishing where to go in anything other than fairly normal traditional driving on like regular lined roads that are kind of perfect if the road does weird stuff it it kind of gets lost and can't really figure it out the other drawback of autopilot is that Tesla for some reason still does not have a capacitive touch steering wheel in my Mercedes if you're driving around using their driver assist Tech which functions about the same as autopilot you just have to have your hand on the steering wheel and the steering wheel will sense that your hand is there and then do what it's supposed to do and you never really have to do anything Tesla unfortunately because they don't have a capacitive touch wheel you actually have to jiggle the steering wheel every so often in order to remind autopilot that you're still there and babysit it in a way that you don't with a car that has a really good capacitive touch steering wheel for their driver assist I generally think this car is better than the old one it has some real improvements over the outgoing model 3 they're subtle but they're there um and more importantly it's just a really good Appliance commuter car that's what it does best and it does that even better than before and so that's the new 2024 Tesla Model 3 this isn't an exciting car not a particularly fun or thrilling one not a car that arouses your passions but it is a great car for its intended purpose making commuting as easy and simple and painfree as possible that's what it's for and that's what it does fantastically and now it's time to give the updated model 3 a Doug score and the Doug score is here 63 out of 100 which puts the new model 3 here against Rivals the daily score is tremendous 38 out of 50 which beats out everything else on this list but the weekend score is comparatively low mainly because well this car really isn't all that exciting here's the truth the Tesla Model 3 is an appliance and just like every other Appliance your dishwasher your microwave it's not not really thrilling it's a tool for a job and this car is the best tool for the job of boring commuting in Daily [Music] traffic"

        "transcript": "(gentle music) - Okay, so the Tesla\nRobtaxi unveiling event was a couple days ago and it might be the weirdest tech event I've ever been to. You might have seen some\nclips from it at this point. I was there, I rode in\nthe self-driving Robotaxi. I explored the insane looking Robovan and I talked to the Optimus robot and then I left feeling kind of confused. It was a weird event. So here are the three\nmain big reasons why. So first of all, the robo\ncab, this was the main thing that we knew we were going\nto see, this full unveiling of a fully self-driving Tesla. And we saw it and it looked like this, very, very much like a mini Cybertruck. Like you've got the\nlight bar on the front, the light bar on the back, the complete lack of rear visibility. Then, of course you can\nsee it's a two-door, two seater passenger car. People were wondering like what a full self-driving\nrobo cab or cyber taxi, whatever we're calling it\nwould actually look like whether it'd look dramatically different from a normal car like a\nModel 3 or even a Waymo. And there are some things that\nare significantly different about this thing they rolled out. I mean on the outside it's light gold. Every single one is this\nlike silvery gold color, although there was never any\nmention of actual materials. Pretty small footprint,\nyou can see there's no exterior door handles, or\nmirrors, or anything like that. And then, since they don't\nneed any steering wheel or pedals, they can sort of push the seating position way\nback into this more like loungey seating position kind\nof near the middle of the car there's a center armrest and there's a massive 21 inch\ntouchscreen in the center. And yes, the doors go up\nas if Tesla hasn't learned from their lessons of the Model X, they're making another crazy set of doors which, honestly, is\ndefinitely a hit visually. It's a striking feature of\nthis car alongside the wheels which, at first, just look\nlike these huge gold discs. But then, when you take a closer look, they're actually just normal 21 inch low rolling resistance continental tires. But they've painted half\nof the sidewall gold to match the caps in the middle. So it makes it look like a\nsuper thin low profile tire with a huge wheel, but\nit's not, it's just paint. But either way, no idea how\nmuch of this is gonna make it to any sort of final production. But after waiting in line for a bit, I got to ride in this\nthing for a few minutes. So I got in, the screen told\nme to buckle my seatbelt, and once I did, the door\nautomatically closed, pretty smart. Then I just selected the destination, which was on this screen along this route, which I assume was pre-mapped. And then it just started\nrolling, just started going. Now, I've been in a\nself-driving Tesla before, but this one is just a\nlittle bit more nervy since there's people everywhere and there's no steering\nwheel in front of me. But once you get over the eeriness of basically being trapped\nin this driverless car with no manual override,\nI started looking around and noticing a few other things. You know, you sit pretty low to the road, similar to a Model 3,\nbut with more leg room since the seating position's further back. And then, there's even\nfewer physical controls than ever before in this car. Like I basically only found\nthat the window switches were in the middle next to the cup holders. I didn't even see any door latches. Like the doors only opened with a button on this enormous touch screen. So again, like a Tesla, it's\ngonna control everything in the car on the screen\nincluding just watching movies while the car is driving because why not? So you can watch the entire trip that I took uncut on\nthe auto-focus channel if you want, I'll link that below. But then the thing is\nthat's kind of all we got. Like there were shockingly\nfew details about the actual car actually\nexplained at this event other than basically like\nthe three main pillars which are gonna be in all the\nheadlines which are number one that it will be fully\nunsupervised, self-driving capable. Number two, that it'll\nbe able to be purchased for under $30,000, all right. But then number three, that\nit would actually also charge by inductive wireless charging. So it pulls up over this\nwireless charging pad on the ground and it\nwould charge that way. Not something we've seen\nshipping in very many cars, especially not ones with large\nbatteries, but that was it. No other numbers, no other specs. Just look at this thing,\nthere's just concepts of a plan. I just had so many other\nquestions after seeing that. Like what is going on here? I did at the event walk\naround after the announcement and bump into some Tesla engineers and people who had been\nworking on these things. And so, I just ended up\nkind of grilling them. Like I asked them a\nwhole bunch of questions. So I'm gonna tell you guys\nwhat I learned from them and I guess we can take their word for it. So first of all, there\nis no steering wheel or pedals, as you can see\nso my first question was, all right, let's say I\nsee an accident coming or there's something happening\non the road in front of me and the car isn't reacting in time, is there a manual override? And the answer I got\nwas, sure, there will be some sort of minimal\nonscreen controls available, but the goal is that you\nnever have to override which is a noble goal, for sure. I just mean it's hard to imagine. We live in a world\nwhere that's impossible, basically, right now but I mean, even with the wireless charger, picture you wanna like drive over the top of it and line it up perfectly because if it's off a little bit, that's just a giant waste of power. But if I can't adjust it\nlike that would be terrible. But speaking of wireless charging, you might be wondering why\nthey would try to do this? The main answer, again,\nis because they want it to be totally autonomous. They want people to just\nbe able to own several, like a fleet of these things\nand they all just drive around and charge themselves overnight. And the whole cable\nplugging in charging thing requires a human so that's\none less human required. It'll just line up on the notoriously inefficient wireless charger. But my question again was, okay, is there at least a charge port\nso if I want to supercharge or charge quickly, I can do that? And the answer was, no, there is no charge port on this vehicle. So it is not even capable of\nhitting a Tesla supercharger, or doing any sort of road trips, or anything like that, it's purely a taxi. I'm told there is no\nplans for a front trunk. There's just the rear trunk that they showed in this presentation. And there's no planned range\nor a stated battery size. But what they did say\nis they're simply aiming for this vehicle to be\nas efficient as possible, that's their main goal,\nbetween the aerodynamics and the low rolling\nresistance tires, they think they can aim for about 5.5\nmiles per kilowatt hour. Some of the most efficient\nelectric cars we see today are getting around 3 to 4\nmiles per kilowatt hour. So this would be like\nan A plus efficiency, if they achieve this and\nthat's what will let them use a smaller overall size battery for the lighter weight of the vehicle. So it'll be nice, they're\nsaying, to clear 200 miles of total range and that would put this at maybe a 40 kilowatt hour battery pack instead of the typical 70 to 130. So drive train wise, that\nlogic does check out. You wanna make the cheapest,\nmost efficient electric car of all time, you gotta hit those things. But then again, you're\nalso telling us this while doing a car with scissor\ndoors and wireless charging. So you're gonna have some\nchallenges there, for sure. But really I think the obvious red flag, the biggest red flag to me\nis the timeline stuff that, I mean this is notorious Elon stuff. He gets on stage, he\nsays, \"We're gonna have \"this vehicle out for\n$30,000 before 2027.\" No they're not, there's just no way that they're actually\ngonna be able to do that. I mean if they do, let's say they do, I will shave my head on camera 'cause I'm not confident they won't do it. Like I wanna be optimistic,\nbut there's just too much stacked up against it because in order to ship this at all with no steering wheel and everything, they have to get all\nthe regulatory approval for the full self-driving and all that, and get all the prices\ndown in spite of inflation and ship something with scissor\ndoors and all this stuff in the next two years,\nthere's just no way. Tesla's been promising full\nunsupervised self-driving for years over and over and over again and consistently keeps pushing it back. But then also just\nprice-wise, I get the goal, but Tesla promised a $35,000\nModel 3 and years later I think they briefly\nactually shipped that car for that price for a little\nbit before discontinuing it. Cybertruck, I don't know if you remember, do you remember the base price of what they said the Cybertruck would cost at the cheapest version when it came out? $39,000 and that was about what, like four or five years ago? Do you know what the cheapest\nCybertruck is right now? $95,000, so you can see where\nmy skepticism is coming from. But even after all that, you know, there's kind of a\nphilosophical question too which is what is the\ndifference between this, this Robotaxi thing and a Model 3? Because Tesla has been promising for years that the car that people are driving and buying today is gonna be capable of full unsupervised self-driving, like the Model 3 and the Model Y? And it's actually not clear if there's that many differences. I mean, obviously, okay, one's\ngonna have a steering wheel and four doors and four\nseats and the whole thing and maybe be a bit more expensive. But like, yeah, if my car is gonna be able to do all that stuff I think I want the one that can plug into superchargers and do all sorts of carrying things. Maybe this will be an old fashioned way of thinking at some time in the future, like every car on the road is autonomous and it's like an \"old\nschool\" thing to want the one with the steering wheel that\nyou can drive sometimes, maybe. I think the main\nadvantage of the Robotaxi, if it has the exact same capabilities as a Model 3 is it'll\nbe cheaper, and smaller and easier to operate\nin a fleet situation. That will probably be the main difference as far as actually buying these things because they've been\nselling people the dream of the car that you buy and own today, you'll drive it to work and\nthen, when you're at work, it'll go drive people around as an Uber for 10 hours or however long and then, you drive it home when you need it and then, when you're\nsleeping it'll continue to drive and Uber people around. And so, it has all these\namazing capabilities, it'll do all this great\nstuff, but will it though? There's actually a moment I had to re-watch the event 'cause I was there and people are like\nyelling out the whole time like stuff at Elon on stage. And at this point in the\npresentation he goes like, oh yeah, Model 3 and Model Y\nwill also do full self-driving. And then someone goes like,\nwhat about the Cybertruck? And then he says, oh yeah,\ndon't worry, Cybertruck too. - So and Cybertruck too, yes, of course. Sorry, I don't wanna forget, yes, yes. All our cars, basically. - So yeah, okay, all our vehicles great, but then it's kind of quiet, but then someone else yells\nout, \"What about Hardware 3?\" Which is, basically if you don't know, a reference to older Model 3s. And his response... - So... [Audience Member] Hardware\n3, Hardware 3, Hardware 3. - Let's not get nuanced here. - [Audience Member] What?\n- All right, next slide. - So yeah, let's not get\ntoo nuanced, all our cars will have it except maybe\nsome of the old ones. All our cars will be able to\nself-drive though, totally. We'll cross that bridge when\nwe get to it, how 'bout that? But here's a bridge that I don't think we'll ever actually get to cross, which is the second thing that was insane that was announced at this\nevent, which is the Robovan. So somewhere about halfway\nthrough this presentation, they roll out this one of one super futuristic looking\nmassive van thing. Kind of looked like a... It looked like the military vehicles from\n\"I, Robot,\" to be honest, which that's probably not a good thing. But yeah, it rolls out and they give us, again, very, very few details. This is gonna be a Robovan that can hold like up to 20-ish people and it, again, will be fully electric\nand fully autonomous and take groups or teams of\npeople from point A to point B. No manual override necessary, great. Have you ever been to CES? Have you ever watched videos from CES? Every year in January\nthere's this trade show, it's really fun, in\nVegas and if you ever go, you'll notice in the south hall there's a section with all the\ncars, the mobility section. And you'll find about 50 of these, every year there's just like\na van with no steering wheel and a bunch of seats\nthat all face the middle. And it's like the future\nof mobility concept. There's tons of those. None of them ever ship, of\ncourse, because there are rules. But I guess there's\nnot, to me, a whole lot that differentiates that brief concept we saw at the Tesla event with dozens of other vaporware versions of this that I've seen before,\nthat's all I'm saying. I mean, the fact that\nthis one comes from Tesla is the main differentiator,\nthis is the company that could maybe\ntheoretically make it happen. But like I said, there's almost\nno details about this thing. And I have almost no faith that\nthat thing that they showed with its minimal clearance,\nand its glass everywhere and just lack of numbers or anything I don't think that we'll\never actually see that thing. I could eat my words, but\nlike that seems crazy. But then last but not least,\nTesla decided to bring back... They decided to remind\nus that they're also an AI company, not just a car company by bringing back out the\nOptimus humanoid robot again. So they had these things all\nover this event this time, dancing, doing these pre-rehearsed demos. But also, they were just\nkind of out and about. They were serving drinks and snacks and they were walking\naround and interacting with and entertaining people\njust like hanging out amongst everyone at this event. Now, I already have my thoughts\nthat I've talked about, you know, humanoid robots before. I made a whole video about\nit, if you wanna watch it, I'll leave a link below the Like button. I've talked about Tesla's Optimus. But even just what we saw with that, would've been a huge step forward\nfrom what we've ever seen. Like this would've been one of the most impressive things ever. But then, they decided to take it further. They also decided to have\nthese robots talking to people and, I mean, it was way\ntoo fast to be an LLM. Like just watch this clip. - [Optimus] Would you\nlike a piece of chocolate? - I will take some chocolate. - [Optimus] Right on, what's your name? - [Vanessa] Vanessa. - [Optimus] Vanessa? - Yes, Vanessa. - [Optimus] Nice, pleasure\nto meet you, Vanessa. - Nice to meet you too.\n- [Optimus] I'm Optimus. - [Optimus] Have a great night\n- [Vanessa] Great Optimus thank you.\n- [Optimus] Bye. - Like it's just a person, it's a person talking through a speaker. It it even like stutters and makes occasional like human mistakes. If you watch a bunch of\nvideos from the event, a bunch of different robots all have slightly different voices. Yeah, it was a person, for sure. And it's weird because Tesla, at no point, at least as of the time of recording, has not acknowledged this at all. They haven't said that or confirmed that, but people there at the event\nhave heard various things from various engineers,\nI talked to two engineers who only would tell me,\nyes, all of the LLMs do run totally on device. But like, yeah, no, I don't think so. So this kind of became\nlike the talking point of the whole event, like now we don't know how much of this event\nwas real or not so real. Like how much of what\nthese robots are doing is human controlled or AI. You know, there were all\nkinds of hand waving, and gestures and movements. I played charades with one of them. You know what it reminds me of? Remember that video I did at\nDisney's Imagineering Labs where they had these bipedal robots that were controlled by\na steam deck controller? They did all kinds of walking around and stringing animations together to entertain people at the parks. There's just a bunch of button presses and controllers to make that happen. And sure, there's some\nAI to blend that stuff, but you could never deny that there's, basically, entirely human\ncontrol happening here. And that's, basically,\nwhat I think is happening at this Tesla event, lots of impressive and entertaining things in the form of a super advanced articulating robot stringing animations together. But it's just not totally ready\nto do this stuff on its own. We've never seen anything quite like it, even from Boston Dynamics,\nbut we gotta be real about the human assisted part. But the thing is, the dream that they are selling people\nwith this specific robot is that this thing will\nlive with you basically, it will be your human\nsized friend, actually. They said that it would be your friend, it would do chores for you,\nit would live around you and be able to do all these\nsorts of tasks on its own using the AI and the vision-based system. I think that's a really far off dream. AI is really, really quickly improving. But I still think that's a far off dream. So, you know, to their credit,\nthis event, it was insane. Like they did a lot of things\nthat could have gone wrong. And if you told me in 2024 that a company would do a bunch of self-driving car demos around tons of people\njust loose in the road and they would have bipedal\nhumanoid robots roaming around performing tasks\nand entertaining people at the same event and that they would have a drone show like that\nis just a lot of stuff in a row that is super high tech that could go wrong, but somehow didn't. And it represented, I think,\na very optimistic view of the future, even though\nit's very much still like concepts, it's a future that is potentially way more efficient,\npotentially way safer and more impressive in\ngeneral technologically than the world we live in today. So that by itself, I think is honorable. The things that they\nwere hoping to be real would be amazing and inspirational and honorable if they actually happened. But since they are also\na public tech company, they felt the need to do demos and give all these big promises. And that's where it felt\nweird because it's really hard to make promises about when\nwe're gonna deliver this future and for what price we're\ngonna deliver this future when it just feels very unlikely. And then doing the like, robots talking, it's just like now the\nwhole thing is in question. Like how much of it is real,\nhow much of it is fake? And then, now we're focusing on that instead of how cool the future\ncould someday actually be. That's where I'm at but\nhey, if there is one company that has the best chance of\nbringing this all to life, if you made me bet money on one company that I think has the best\nodds to get there eventually, then, yeah, it would be the one with the massive data gathering advantage with stuff out there in\nthe real world today. It would be Tesla so I'll\nbelieve it when I see it. Thanks for watching, catch you\nguys in the next one, peace."

        "transcript": "this is the new refreshed version of the extremely popular model 3 the new headlights and tail lights give it a sleeker more aggressive look they also improv the materials inside of the cabin so you no longer get that wooden trim that made you feel like you were in an Apple store and they added customizable ambient lighting throughout the interior they even added a secondary display in the back for temperature controls and watching content with separate Bluetooth connectivity which is perfect if you've got forward- facing little ones in the back and there are a lot of little changes you can find here like ventilated and heated seats up front a larger and more responsive main display and even real pressable haptic buttons on the steering wheel it's got improved noise reduction from outside sounds if you like a quiet cabin and overall it's just a more comfortable ride so if you're looking to get into the EV game I'd recommend this without hesitation"
